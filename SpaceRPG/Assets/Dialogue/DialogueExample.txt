# Empty lines are ignored, so are lines starting with #
# NPC starter line
Hello  traveler

# Sample player response.
# Start with four spaces to indicate player response. Players can have multiple choices,  just list them here
    Hi.
    Greetings.

# NPC line can also be multiple lines, but they are just rendered one after another sequentially
Perhaps you've heard the tale of the one true pirate of the galaxy?
	Yes <JUMP 2>
	No
His name is Stan

# Possible player responses that leads to different 'scenes'. Just add the scene at the end
# This is where branch happens
    I am Stan. <JUMP 3>
    That's just a fairy tale <JUMP 4>
# You may also default to nothing so the conversation continues
    Can you tell me more?
He was the kind of pirate that everyone loved.
He robbed only the rich and corrupted, and never hurt an innocent fly.

# Here let's introduce conditions. Certain things are only available if the conditions are met, and you do  it like this
<IF Morale MORETHAN 5>
    Well, he sounds  like quite a man
    Doesn't matter, criminals need to be brought down<JUMP 4>
<ENDIF>
    That's something.

# Essentially, there will be a bunch of 'flags' that contains either a value, or just 'true/false'.
# So something like 'Morale' will be a value from -10(Really bad person) to 10(Really good person)
# And something like 'HasBeenArrested' will  just be 'true/false'
# You can do condition like '<IF HasBeenArrested>', and the following item up until the corresponding <ENDIF> will only show if the condition is met
# You can also do things like '<IF HasBeenArrested AND Morale < 5>' as combinations,  but keep it simple.
# Things like 'A AND B OR C' can be ambiguous depends on how you look at it. You could always place another <IF> inside an if like
# <IF A OR B>
#	<IF C>
#		SOMETHING HERE 
#	<ENDIF>
# <ENDIF>

Indeed. But, all good things come to an end.
He had a downfall. No one really know what happened.
But one day, he just up and vanished.

# At the end of a scene, you can return something as result and end the conversation, or jump to a different scene with <JUMP #> just like player choices
# The thing you return should be a non-negative number.
# 0 should always mean nothing special happened, aka no further action required
# Things like listening to a story, asking directions, or refusing a trivial quest (Since refusing major quests could have an impact on the story)
# THings that won't lead to any change in the game
# But if they do, you'll have to make up numbers and document what they mean
# It would be nice if you have a collection of all return values at the end,  so I can just glance at them and know how to handle them
<RETURN 0>

# NPC skip explain about stain
<SCENE 2>
Well, I won't repeat myself then. Anyway.
<JUMP 5>

# NPC disbelief
<SCENE 3>
HAHA, good one.
<RETURN 0>

# NPC shun non believer
<SCENE 4>
Keep that attitude up, and you are gonna get killed some day,  kiddo.
<RETURN 0>

# Player claim justice
<SCENE 5>
If that's the case, wanna help out with some local bandits?
They've been terrorizing the neighborhood. Should be an easy challenge.
    All right. <JUMP 6>
    I don't have the time
that's a shame.
<RETURN 0>

# Player accept quest
<SCENE 6>
Go knock em' dead.
<RETURN 1>

# RETURN values:
# 0: Nothing
# 1: Accept 'Kill local bandits' quest
